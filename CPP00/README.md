Namespace

In programming, a namespace is like a folder that helps keep things organized. It's a way to group together similar things, like variables or functions, so they don't get mixed up with other stuff in your code.

Namespaces provides a method for preventing name conflicts in large projects. It allows you to group symbols that are related together.
